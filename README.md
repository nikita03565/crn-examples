# Examples repo

To run examples clone both repos https://github.com/nikita03565/city-road-network and this one.

Create and activate virtual env with your favorite tool. I prefer pyenv.

`cd` into `city-road-network` and run `pip install .` and `pip install jupyter` with your virtual env activated.
